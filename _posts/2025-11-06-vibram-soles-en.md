Vibram is the global leader in high-performance outsoles. For Canadian conditions—snow, ice and rough terrain—Vibram soles are often the best option.

## Most popular Vibram models

- **Vibram 1136 Montagna** – aggressive lug pattern for snow and mountain terrain  
- **Vibram 430 Mini-Lug** – lower profile, excellent grip in the city and on the job  
- **Vibram 4014 Christy** – wedge sole for all-day comfort  

Chez Gerry 1958 offers boots equipped with Vibram soles as well as professional resoling services.
