One of the biggest advantages of Red Wing boots is that they are resoleable.

## Why resoleable boots make sense

- Keep the same comfortable upper for years  
- Only replace the worn-out outsole  
- Less waste compared to buying new boots constantly  
- Long-term savings and more sustainable consumption
