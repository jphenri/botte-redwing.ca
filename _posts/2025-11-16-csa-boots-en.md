CSA-approved work boots are mandatory on most job sites in Canada. They protect workers from impact, compression and puncture hazards.

## Types of safety toes

- **Steel toe** – very strong and durable  
- **Composite toe** – lighter and non-metallic  
- **Aluminum toe** – lighter than steel but still strong  

Red Wing CSA boots combine safety, comfort and longevity.
