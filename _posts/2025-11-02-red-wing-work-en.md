Red Wing work boots are widely considered the best choice for Canadian workers. Built with high-quality full-grain leather and Goodyear Welt construction, they outperform most mainstream work boots in durability and comfort.

## Why choose Red Wing work boots?

- Long-lasting comfort  
- Premium full-grain leather  
- Slip-resistant Vibram or Traction Tred outsoles  
- CSA-certified models for Canadian job sites  
- Typically last 2–3× longer than cheap work boots
