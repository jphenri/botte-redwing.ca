Red Wing boots can last for a decade or more with proper care.

## 1. Clean

- Use a soft brush to remove dirt and dust  
- Wipe with a slightly damp cloth if necessary  

## 2. Condition

Recommended products:

- Red Wing Leather Cream  
- Mink Oil  
- Boot Oil  

## 3. Protect

- Apply water and salt protection spray  
- Let dry away from direct heat  

## 4. Resole when needed

When the outsole is worn down, a Vibram resole gives your boots a new life.
